        <h1>🔥 The Mahabharata: Saga of Destiny, Dharma & Destruction 🔥</h1>
        <p>The greatest epic of all time, revealing the battle between Dharma and Adharma.</p>

        <h2>📜 Introduction: The Birth of an Epic</h2>
        <p>
            The Mahabharata is one of the greatest epics in human history. It was composed by <strong>Sage Vyasa</strong>, who sought to document the events surrounding the great Kurukshetra War and its deeper philosophical meanings.
        </p>

        <h2>🔍 How It Started</h2>
        <p>
            According to legend, Vyasa dictated the entire epic to <strong>Lord Ganesha</strong>, who agreed to write it down on one condition: Vyasa had to keep reciting without pause. As the tale unfolded, Ganesha, in his eagerness, broke one of his tusks and used it as a pen to ensure the story was recorded without interruption.

        <h2>❓ Why Was It Written?</h2>
        <p>
            The Mahabharata was written to serve as a <strong>spiritual and moral guide</strong> for future generations. It is a reflection of the eternal struggle between <strong>Dharma (righteousness) and Adharma (unrighteousness)</strong>. Through its characters, dilemmas, and teachings, it conveys lessons about <strong>duty, honor, destiny, and the consequences of human choices</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>📍 Where & When Did It Happen?</h2>
        <p>
            The events of the Mahabharata took place in ancient India, mainly in the kingdom of <strong>Hastinapura</strong>, which was the seat of power for the Kuru dynasty. Historians suggest that the Kurukshetra War occurred around <strong>3000 BCE</strong>, though its exact timeline remains debated.

        <h2>🌟 What Was Its Purpose?</h2>
        <p>
            At its core, the Mahabharata is more than just a story of kings and battles—it is a <strong>mirror of life itself</strong>. It illustrates that <strong>even the greatest heroes have flaws, and the most feared villains have motivations</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The war of Kurukshetra was not just a fight for a throne but a test of <strong>values, duty, sacrifice, and divine intervention</strong>. The teachings of <strong>Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita</strong>, a part of this grand epic, continue to be revered as one of the greatest spiritual discourses ever given.
